She has hired you as an SQL specialist to get the answers to her business questions, such as:

- **How many bikes does the shop own by category?**
- **What was the rental revenue for each month?**



The answers are hidden in the database, and our job is to figure out how to extract them using SQL.

This case study is taken from [LearnSQL.com](https://learnsql.com). It is part of the **"November 2023 SQL Challenge"** course.
