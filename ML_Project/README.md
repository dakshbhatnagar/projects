# Horse Survival Dataset Analysis

## Introduction
This repository contains an analysis of the Horse Colic Dataset, a collection of medical records for horses suffering from colic. The goal is to predict the outcome (survival or non-survival) based on various attributes.

## Dataset Information
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Database
- **Instances:** 368
- **Attributes:** 28
- **Missing Values:** Present (NA's)

## Attributes
- **Demographic information:** Age, hospital number
- **Clinical measurements:** Rectal temperature, pulse, respiratory rate, etc.
- **Subjective assessments:** Pain level, mucous membranes, capillary refill time, etc.
- **Treatment and diagnostic information:** Surgery, nasogastric tube, abdominocentesis, etc.
- **Outcome:** Lived, died, euthanized
- **Lesion type and location**

## Analysis
- **Data preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature scaling
- **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)**
- **Feature selection and engineering**
- **Model development:** Classification
- **Evaluation and validation**

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required libraries (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn).
3. Run `ML.ipynb` to execute the analysis and modeling code.
