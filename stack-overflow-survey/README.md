## Caveats and Assumptions

- **Data Source Reliability**: The dataset is sourced from the [official website](https://survey.stackoverflow.co), which is generally considered reliable. However, the accuracy of the responses depends on the honesty and understanding of the respondents.

- **Sample Representation**: The survey may not represent the entire developer population globally, as it primarily captures responses from users of Stack Overflow, potentially skewing results towards more active or engaged developers.

- **Self-Reported Data**: The data is self-reported, meaning that respondents may misinterpret questions or provide inaccurate information regarding their skills, experiences, or demographics.

- **Temporal Context**: The survey reflects a snapshot of the developer community at a specific time (2024). Trends and preferences may change rapidly in the tech industry, and findings may not hold true in future years.

- **Data Format and Usability**: While the survey results have been converted to a parquet file for ease of use, users should be familiar with handling this format and may need appropriate tools to analyze the data effectively.

- **Question Interpretation**: Some survey questions may be open to interpretation, leading to variations in how different respondents understand and answer them, which could affect the consistency of the data.
